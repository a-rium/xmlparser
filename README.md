# xmlparser - A simple, no-fuss XML data parser
`xmlparser` is a Python module for reading, working and writing with XML data.

Its main appeal is its simplicity, both in implementation and its usability.By design, this module does not offer any kind of formal XML validation, focusing instead on flexibility and ease-of-use. 

This module was born from the need of a simple XML parser who leaves all the namespaces logics up to the user, treating them just as a special kind of attributes.

# TODO
- Add support for the default namespace
- Add typing annotations to all method signatures and class definitions
